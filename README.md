It is currently deployed [here](https://scary-grave-19647.herokuapp.com/)!

If you want to check it out, go to the directory where you want to clone it and then:

`git clone https://github.com/rja907/Emaily.git`

`npm i` (to install the dependencies)

`npm run dev` (to start the local server)

After this, you'll be redirected to your browser where you can test the app out. Remember, some functionality might not be available because I did not commit my secret keys.

Let me know what you thought about it!
